# Updates on the predictions

According to our model, **Italy** could be now at the peak. It would be essential checking the data in the next days in order to verify if the decrease trend becomes consolidated.

Our model for **Spain** is today quite optimistic, showing the curve reaching the peak with a good fitting.

The evolution of Covid-19 in **France** has been slower. According to our model, we might be still around 10 days behind the peak.

The case of the **UK** is quite interesting, showing the curve still an early stage of the propagation, with the peak still more than three weeks ahead. Because of its early evolution the predictions might still change depending on the effect of confinement actions.

In the **USA**, the evolution seems to follow a pattern less bleak than what some projections were expecting.
