# Updates on the predictions

According to our model, **Italy** could be now at the peak. It would be essential checking the data in the next days in order to verify if the decrease trend becomes consolidated.

Our model for **Spain** today predicts the curve reaching the peak with a good fitting except for the latest data. Therefore, it would be necessary to wait for new data in order to validate it.

The evolution of Covid-19 in **France** has been slower. According to our model, we might be still around 5 days behind the peak.

The case of the **UK** is quite interesting, showing the curve still an early stage of the propagation, with the peak still more than three weeks ahead. Because of its early evolution the predictions might still change depending on the effect of confinement actions.

In the **USA**, the evolution seems to follow a pattern less bleak than what some projections were expecting.
